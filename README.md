Legacy WordPress recovery and rebuild for Fo Guang Shan NZ

# FGS NZ Legacy Site Restoration

This repo contains the restored and rebuilt WordPress site for Fo Guang Shan NZ. The original site was broken—corrupted databases, missing media, and outdated architecture. Over 10 weeks, I rebuilt it from the ground up using WordPress, PHP, and modular CSS, with a focus on scalability, accessibility, and clean design.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repo  
2. Activate the custom theme in WordPress  
3. Install and configure the following plugins:
   - Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)
   - Custom Post Type UI (CPT UI)
   - Media Sync (for legacy media recovery)
